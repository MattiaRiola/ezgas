Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
The use of Spring framework allows faster development compared to the direct usage of server application like Tomcat.
The use of documents improved the efficiency of organization the work.
No team divergences were arised.

# Worst things
Remote working makes the communication difficult.
The complete coverage of the test was redundant due to the fact that some classes presents only setter and getter.
Some minor unexpected behaviors were discovered, for instance the registration of a user that was already registered; this situation wasn't specified in the documents.
 
# Suggestions 
Do not cover in test the redundant or unnecessary method/classes.
Keep using telegram and skype for communication, meeting and git synchronization.
