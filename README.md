# EZGas

SE 2020 project

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
* collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
* locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC)

## Project goals and description

In this project the students had to develop together the backend of this web application.
The focus of this project is the organization of the whole team using a cascade approach.
The part of the web application written by the students has to be solid, well tested and documented, for this reason the documents stored in the doc folder will be evaluated  by the teachers.
*Note:* this project was made entirely from home during covid-19's lockdown.
